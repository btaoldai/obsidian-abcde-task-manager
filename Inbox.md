## 📝 Usage Instructions

### How it Works

When you create a **Quick Task** from the Dashboard:

1. A **project page** is automatically created in the appropriate category folder
2. A **task item** is added to this Inbox with a link [[📄]] to the project page
3. The task appears in the **appropriate priority section** above

### Example Task Format

```markdown
- [ ] #task #administrative/A1 #urgent Analyze security logs [[ADMINISTRATIVE-Analyze-logs-2025-10-28|📄]] 📅 2025-10-29 ⏫
```

**Components**:
- `[ ]` - Checkbox (unchecked = active, checked = completed)
- `#task` - Task identifier
- `#administrative/A1` - Category + priority + random number
- `#urgent` - Additional tags (optional)
- `Analyze security logs` - Task name
- `[[ADMINISTRATIVE-Analyze-logs-2025-10-28|📄]]` - Link to project page
- `📅 2025-10-29` - Due date
- `⏫` - Priority indicator (A=⏫, B=🔼, C=none)

### Moving Tasks

**To Dashboard Kanban**:
- Tasks here automatically appear in Dashboard → "🔴 TODAY" section
- Open Dashboard to see urgent tasks

**To Kanban Board**:
- Open `Dashboards/Kanban-Board.md`
- Drag tasks between columns

**Mark Complete**:
- Click checkbox: `[ ]` → `[x]`
- Task moves to "✅ Completed Tasks" section

### Clean Up

Periodically:
1. Review completed tasks
2. Archive or delete old tasks
3. Keep inbox focused on active work
